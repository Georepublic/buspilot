### Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy outlines how the Buspilot Add-on collects, uses, shares, retains, and protects any information that you provide when using this add-on.

## Data Collection and Use

The Buspilot Add-on collects personal information only when explicitly provided by you for the purpose of updating and managing GTFS documents, app content, and user access control. The types of personal information collected may include:

- Contact details such as email addresses, primarily for GitHub, Firebase account management, and whitelisting users for access control.
- Data related to bus routes, app content, and access rights (via the whitelist), which are inputted directly by users.

This data is used exclusively to publish and synchronize bus schedules to GitHub, Firebase, and manage user access control as directed by user actions.

## Data Sharing, Transfer, or Disclosure

We do not share, transfer, or disclose your personal information to third parties unless required by law or with your explicit consent. Data is shared only within the systems you connect to (e.g., GitHub, Firebase) for the purpose of publishing or synchronizing bus schedules, managing app-related data, and controlling user access, as initiated by user actions.

## Data Retention and Deletion

We retain your data for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as long as updates are being published or synchronized. Data will remain on GitHub or Firebase until updated, deleted, or replaced by the user.

You can delete your data by:
- Publishing an updated spreadsheet with the desired changes.
- Publishing an empty spreadsheet to delete all related data, including whitelisted users, from GitHub and Firebase.

For any specific data deletion requests, please contact support at [support@georepublic.de](mailto:support@georepublic.de).

## Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
